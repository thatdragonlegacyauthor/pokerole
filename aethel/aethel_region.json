Two legendary Pokémon, Yggdrys and Fimbulstorm, were born from the void and began a great war that shaped the region. A third creature, Mischievian, a trickster god, intervened by stealing the light from the sky, forcing the two legendary Pokémon to a truce. From this truce, the Aethel region was born, and from the great war, three legendary bears were born: Aquilon, Terrin, and Aurabeast."
